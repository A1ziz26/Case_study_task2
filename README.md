<h1>1. Project Overview</h1>
This project involves predicting segmentation classes using various machine learning models and techniques. The task includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction on test data.

<h1>2. Required Libraries</h1>
To run the project, ensure the following libraries are installed:
<h1>Core Libraries:</h1>
Python 3.7 or later
pandas
numpy
<h1>Machine Learning Libraries:</h1>

xgboost
lightgbm
imbalanced-learn
<h1>Deep Learning Framework:</h1>
tensorflow
Visualization Libraries:
matplotlib
seaborn

<h1>3. Installing Required Libraries</h1>
Run the following command to install the required libraries:
Code:
<h1>pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm tensorflow imbalanced-learn</h1>




4. Data
The project uses a dataset with demographic and segmentation details.
Ensure you have the train and test datasets in .csv format.
Place the dataset files in the directory: randomnforest/.

5. Setup Instructions
 1.Clone the Repository
	Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
	Copy code
	git clone <repository-link>
the Dataset files (train.csv, test.csv) will be in the randomnforest/ directory.
2.Install Dependencies
	Install all required libraries using the command mentioned above. (if you are running in a local machine) or
You can just upload the notebook in collab / kaggle and add the dataset (train2.csv, test2.csv) in the kaggle/input/ create a directory randomforest and add the dataset files. 

6. Running the Code
Run the Jupyter notebook:
Copy code
jupyter notebook main_notebook.ipynb
 `	Or execute the Python script:
	Copy code
	python main_script.py
The predictions for the test data will be saved as submission.csv in the project directory.

7. Outputs
Trained models for various segmentation tasks.
Performance comparison across models and datasets.
Predictions for the test dataset saved in submission.csv.
8. Additional Information
